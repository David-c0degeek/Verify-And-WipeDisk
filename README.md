# Verify-And-WipeDisk
A safe, interactive PowerShell script to verify and securely wipe Windows-accessible disks by clearing partition tables, overwriting the first 1GB, and confirming the removal of all headers and mountable data. Ideal for preparing encrypted drives (e.g., LUKS from Unraid) for RMA or secure decommission.
